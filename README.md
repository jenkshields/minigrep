# minigrep

Rust exercise as per the Rust book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch12-00-an-io-project.html

Implemented and functional. Only thing missing is handling case sensitivity via a command line argument, and handling priority between this option and the environment variable. Couldn't quite figure it out.
